#Assignment 1: Extracting Data from JSON

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below:
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_264801.json (Sum ends with 84)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format
The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON as follows:

{
  comments: [
    {
      name: "Matthias"
      count: 97
    },
    {
      name: "Geomer"
      count: 97
    }
    ...
  ]
}
The closest sample code that shows how to parse JSON and extract a list is json2.py. You might also want to look at geoxml.py to see how to prompt for a URL and retrieve data from a URL.

Sample Execution

$ python solution.py 

Enter location: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json

Retrieving http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json

Retrieved 2733 characters

Count: 50

Sum: 2482

#Assignment 2: Calling a JSON API

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geojson.py. The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.
API End Points

To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data:

http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/geojson
This API uses the same parameters (sensor and address) as the Google API. This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get a list of all of the address values which can be used with this API.
To call the API, you need to provide a sensor=false parameter and the address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.urlencode() fuction as shown in http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geojson.py

Test Data / Sample Execution

You can test to see if your program is working with a location of "South Federal University" which will have a place_id of "ChIJJ8oO7_B_bIcR2AlhC8nKlok".

$ python solution.py
Enter location: South Federal University 
Retrieving http://...
Retrieved 2101 characters
Place id ChIJJ8oO7_B_bIcR2AlhC8nKlok 
Turn In

Please run your program to find the place_id for this location:
University of Gothenburg

Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the place_id and your Python code below. Hint: The first seven characters of the place_id are "ChIJ6f7 ..."
Make sure to retreive the data from the URL specified above and not the normal Google API. Your program should work with the Google API - but the place_id may not match for this assignment.
